# ðŸ“ˆ React Trend
### Simple "trending" graph generator

Graphing tools are often complex, abstract, and heavy. They require domain-specific knowledge, and a significant time investment.

While building rich data visualizations for an analytics app, this is a necessary cost. But what if you just need a simple line that shows a trend?

For example, here's how GitHub shows activity on a repo:
![GitHub Trending](misc/documentation-assets/gh-trend.png)

Here's how Twitter displays your recent analytics:
![Twitter Trending](misc/documentation-assets/tw-trend.png)

These are very simple and elegant visualizations, and they do not require a bloated graphing library to produce.

Redux Trend is a concrete component that does 1 thing, and does it well: generate these trending graphs.


## Features

- **Simple**. Integrate in seconds.
- **Scalable**. Uses SVG for sharp, scalable graphs. Will fill the parent container, or you can provide a fixed size.
- **Beautiful**. Built-in gradient support, and customizable smoothing.
- **Animatable**. Set `autoDraw` to have the line 'draw itself'.
- **Tiny**. Zero-dependency, and gzips to just _2.62kb!_


### Installation

```
npm i -S react-trend
```
